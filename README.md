Repo for text analysis of 2020 CSS Survey. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First, you'll need Python 3.7. We recommend using `pyenv` to get this (as well as other versions of Python).

Then you'll need Jupyter Notebook. You can find directions on how to get that [here](https://jupyter.org/install). They recommend downloading Anaconda to get it, but we suggest using `pip` if you're already using `pyenv` to manage your python versions.
